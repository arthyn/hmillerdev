## Skeleton
I started with Dan Urbanowicz's [eleventy-netlify-boilerplate](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate). It provided a great starting point with CSS and JS automatically injected into the head, the template engine that I wanted, and minification already set up. It included great instructions for getting setup with Netlify which was also a big plus.
