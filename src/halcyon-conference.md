# halcyon: an urbit builder's conference

A different kind of conference, named after the Greek myth that kingfisher birds would calm the sea to lay eggs in a floating nest. **halcyon** is a conference for the [Urbit](https://urbit.org) ecosystem to come together and think deeply about how we build software. We hope to achieve a much calmer and more focused energy than [Assembly](https://assembly.urbit.org) and remove the feeling of "missing out" as well as have space for longer term thinking for the future of the ecosystem.

## what is urbit?

[Urbit](https://urbit.org) is a **new kind of computer** that you can **own completely** in ways that matter: **networking, identity, and data.**

We realized that in order to fix the internet, we had to build a new computer from scratch. Good thing we started over a decade ago. Today, Urbit is a real system with thousands of users that are building all kinds of communities, software, DAOs, and more. And itâ€™s getting better every day.

A year ago, there was only one company building Urbit, [Tlon](https://tlon.io). And there was only really one app, Landscape. Today there are now 8+ companies building on Urbit and 80+ apps. Urbit uniquely offers an accelerated developer platform with a lightning fast app idea to prototype to production pipeline.

If you'd like to check out Urbit, you can explore the network for a day at [https://urbit.org/trial](https://urbit.org/trial) or if you just want to hear more, read the [in-depth overview](https://urbit.org/overview).

## conference details

**halcyon** will be a 3 day conference with an optional pre-registration day for those who wish to come early and explore the city. 

During **halcyon**, builders on the Urbit ecosystem will come together to discuss, present, and develop deep technical topics involved in running Urbit computers. There will also be plenty of eating, having fun, and building relationships too. We would also like to invite potential investors to hear pitches from the various Urbit companies looking to raise capital. 

**halcyon** will be semi-exclusive, requiring proof of work for entry. You do not have to be a company. You simply must be someone who is building on Urbit. We may want some way to get genuinely interested parties that are new to Urbit in the door too, but in a limited way.

- Seats limited to < 150. 
- 2-3 areas of focus each year. This should help limit [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) and also help decide if it's worth the time for your interests.
- Lots of breaks and downtime, so people have a chance to connect deeply
- All food provided to help keep people in one place and preserve energy
- Specifically host investor pitches and invite others to watch
- No demos (unless part of a pitch), we only want to see work in progress, behind the scenes thinking, and getting your hands dirty
