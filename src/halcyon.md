# halcyon: an urbit builder's conference

A different kind of conference, named after the Greek myth that kingfisher birds would calm the sea to lay eggs in a floating nest. We hope to achieve a much calmer and more focused energy than Assembly and remove the feeling of "missing out" as well as have space for longer term thinking.

halcyon will be semi-exclusive, requiring proof of work for entry. You do not have to be a company, simply must be someone who is building on urbit. We may want some way to get genuinely interested parties that are new to urbit in the door too, but in a limited way.

- Seats limited to < 100-150. 
- 2-3 areas of focus each year. this should help limit FOMO and also help decide if it's worth the time for your interests.
- Lots of breaks and downtime
- All food provided to help keep people in one place and preserve energy
- specifically host investor pitches, invite others to watch?
- No demos (unless part of a pitch?), we only want to see WIP

Unsure about the name, let me know what you think!
