# About

I'm a creator who has trouble falling in love with his creations. I spend most of my time reading books, articles, and tweets trying to learn and soak up as much information as I can. When I'm not doing that, I'm spending time with my wife, my dog, and my two cats or playing D&D or ranked TFT with friends. No matter what, I'm always cooking delicious vegan food.

I'm engrossed in philosophy, spirituality, and learning how to live a simple, balanced life. I think we're all over-committed and burdened with thoughts about what we should or should not be doing. My philosophy revolves around moving slowly, not reacting too quickly, and being intentional in all that I do.

That bleeds into my development style. I much prefer technology and code that's easy to reason about, expressive but simple, and beneficial to both users and devs.
