<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

I'm <a class="accent" href="https://twitter.com/hmillerdev">Hunter Miller</a>, a front-end architect and web perf enthusiast. I write **Technically UX** to keep the web community talking about how to improve the usability of the experiences we create. By doing so, I hope to bridge the gap between UX, design, and development so that our products can be more cohesive and enjoyable.

## How it started

Technically UX started as an idea for a talk about the **subtle technical interactions** users have with our software that we as developers sometimes forget. They fall into somewhat of a grey area of responsibility between development and UX. My intent was to illuminate these cob webs in the corners of our apps and websites, to help developers start thinking more about what they are building every day.

## What you'll get

Reading this newsletter will help you start thinking more **holistically** about the software you build, notice the **smaller technical details** that you're exposing to users every day, and show how you can create nuance in those interactions to bring **peace to your users**. They may not even realize what's happening, but they'll feel more at ease.
