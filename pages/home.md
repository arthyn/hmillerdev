<div class="home-intro">
    <h1 class="huge">Hi, I'm Hunter!</h1>
    <p>I'm a web developer focused on making people&nbsp;happy.&nbsp;ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
</div>

I love optimizing websites for performance, usability, and code quality which I write about here on the [blog](/blog) and on twitter [{{ metadata.author.twitter }}]({{ metadata.author.twitter_url }}). 

This year I'm working to start [Technically UX](/technically-ux), a consulting business focused on teaching developers how to work more efficiently while delivering more value.
