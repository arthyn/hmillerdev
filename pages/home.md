<h1 class="text-base">Hi, I'm Hunter!</h1>

I'm a software developer creating systems that actually help us and are unintrusive. I love complaining about the current state of UI, software, and computing in general which I write about here and on twitter [{{ metadata.author.twitter }}]({{ metadata.author.twitter_url }}).

During the day, I'm currently working on bringing software distribution to Urbit at [Tlon](https://tlon.io). At night, I'm focused on building the next UI language for the web, Urbit, and native systems.
